A basic social network project 

My aim in this project was to learn **GraphQL**, so I worked mainly on the backend  
-	Used queries and mutations
-	Worked on a server with Express (to be more acurate, with apollo-server-express)
-	Used MongoDB for database
- Used jsonwebtoken for user permission 


Functionalities of this social network backend project :
  - Sign in and sign up users
  -	Oauth and bcrypt for security
  -	Update name of users, as well as password and email 
  -	Create and mutate posts : update posts, delete posts
  -	Create and mutate categories, and added relationship between posts and categories
  - For every query and mutation, when needed I ensured that the user had the right token (jsonwebtoken)
